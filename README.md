This repository is the supplementary material for my latest ICML article titled:
# [Incorporating Information into Shapley Values: Reweighting via Maximum Entropy Approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3692070.3692233)
You can install the required dependencies via the following code
```
$ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml
$ conda activate ./env
```

The the files shared include two .ipynb files that simulate and compute the Shapley values of the examples provided in the Supplementary Material.
